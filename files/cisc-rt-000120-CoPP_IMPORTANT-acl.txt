# NOTES: 
# New ACL Must Match Actual Example Given At The Bottom For The First Line
# Currently a bug in echo_reply that is being fixed and has not been pushed to repo.  
# https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios/pull/626 
#
# There is also a open issue Regarding the way the ios_acl runs the add and remove for the commands.
# If you failed to add permit ip any any to the original acl file and are back here to fix it
# regarding the warning posted at the end of the run. Make sure you add it as Sequence 300 to match 
# how the fix is applied in the system so Shows the task as ok, if Not It will always show changed.

# Example Given In STIG:
# ip access-list extended CoPP_IMPORTANT 
# permit tcp host [TACACS server] eq tacacs any
# permit tcp [management subnet] 0.0.0.255 any eq 22 
# permit udp host [SNMP manager] any eq snmp 
# permit udp host [NTP server] eq ntp any 
# deny ip any any 
#
#
Extended IP access list CoPP_IMPORTANT
10 permit tcp host 1.1.1.1 eq tacacs any
20 permit tcp 1.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 22
30 permit udp host 1.1.1.1 any eq snmp
