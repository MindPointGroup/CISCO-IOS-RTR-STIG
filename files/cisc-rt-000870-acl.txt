# NOTES: 
# New ACL Must Match Actual Example Given At The Bottom For The First Line
# Currently a bug in echo_reply that is being fixed and has not been pushed to repo.  
# https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios/pull/626 
#
# There is also a open issue Regarding the way the ios_acl runs the add and remove for the commands.
# If you failed to add permit ip any any to the original acl file and are back here to fix it
# regarding the warning posted at the end of the run. Make sure you add it as Sequence 300 to match 
# how the fix is applied in the system so Shows the task as ok, if Not It will always show changed.

# Example Given In STIG:
# ip access-list extended IGMP_JOIN_FILTER
# deny ip any 232.8.0.0 0.0.255.255
# permit ip x.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any
# deny ip any any
#
