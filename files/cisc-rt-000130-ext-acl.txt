# NOTES: 
# New ACL Must Match Actual Example Given At The Bottom For The First Line
# Currently a bug in echo_reply that is being fixed and has not been pushed to repo.  
# https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios/pull/626 
#
# There is also a open issue Regarding the way the ios_acl runs the add and remove for the commands.
# If you failed to add deny ip any any log-input to the original acl file and are back here to fix it
# regarding the warning posted at the end of the run. Make sure you add it as Sequence 300 to match 
# how the fix is applied in the system so Shows the task as ok, if Not It will always show changed.

# Example Given In STIG:
# ip access-list extended EXTERNAL_ACL
# permit tcp host x.11.1.1 eq bgp host x.11.1.2
# permit tcp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 eq bgp
# permit icmp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 echo
# permit icmp host x.11.1.1 host x.11.1.2 echo-reply
# deny ip any host x.11.1.1 log-input
# permit …
# …
# …
# …
# deny ip any any log-input <------ MAKE SURE YOU ADD THIS TO THE END OF YOUR ACL.
