# NOTES: 
# New ACL Must Match Actual Example Given At The Bottom For The First Line
# Currently a bug in echo_reply that is being fixed and has not been pushed to repo.  
# https://github.com/ansible-collections/cisco.ios/pull/626 
#
# There is also a open issue Regarding the way the ios_acl runs the add and remove for the commands.
# If you failed to add permit ip any any to the original acl file and are back here to fix it
# regarding the warning posted at the end of the run. Make sure you add it as Sequence 300 to match 
# how the fix is applied in the system so Shows the task as ok, if Not It will always show changed.

# Example Given In STIG:
# ip access-list extended CoPP_CRITICAL 
# remark our control plane adjacencies are critical 
# permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor A] any 
# permit ospf host [OSPF neighbor B] any 
# permit pim host [PIM neighbor A] any 
# permit pim host [PIM neighbor B] any 
# permit pim host [RP addr] any 
# permit igmp any 224.0.0.0 15.255.255.255 
# permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] eq bgp host [local BGP addr] 
# permit tcp host [BGP neighbor] host [local BGP addr] eq bgp 
# deny ip any any 
#

Extended IP access list CoPP_CRITICAL
remark our control plane adjacencies are critical
10 permit ospf host 1.1.1.1 any
